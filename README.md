## About the Project
This project is based on the MedMNIST dataset, a collection of preprocessed medical images designed for easy and fast benchmarking in deep learning tasks.

MedMNIST contains multiple 2D and 3D biomedical image datasets, covering various modalities like X-ray, MRI, and microscopy. Each dataset is labeled and intended for tasks like binary classification, multi-class classification, and multi-label classification.

# Model
We used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the medical images. The model is trained on selected MedMNIST datasets and aims to achieve high accuracy on medical image classification tasks.
